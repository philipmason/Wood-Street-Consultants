/* BROWSING METATDATA FROM SAS

1.  Start SAS 9

2.  Click on the Explorer pane to activate it or use the menu VIEW/CONTENTS ONLY.

3.  Now select TOOLS/OPTIONS/EXPLORER

4.  Under the GENERAL tab select the METADATA SERVERS check box, and then click on OK.

5.  There will now be a new METADATA SERVERS icon in the Explorer pane. Click on this to show its contents. There will be nothing there yet.

6.  Right click in the explorer pane and select NEW. This allows you to define a connection to a metadata server - which may be on your machine, or elsewhere. Define this and any others you may want. 

7.  Now you can continue to drill down through the metadata to examine it.
