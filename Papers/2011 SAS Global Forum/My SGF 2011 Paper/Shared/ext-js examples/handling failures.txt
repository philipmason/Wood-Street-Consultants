All the online samples and book samples I've seen seem to assume that when
you call a url to load a store everything always works - of course real
life isn't like that so over the weekend I was thinking "how do we handle a
situation when the server-side program fails for some reason?"

Not having SAS at home I used PHP and MySQL to simulate a Stored Process
call - although the mechanics are a bit different the principles should
hold true for SAS also.

Here's the simple piece of PHP I used

<?php

$link = mysql_connect('localhost', 'root', '');
if (!$link) {
   die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
}
$db_selected = mysql_select_db('sakila', $link);
if (!$db_selected) {
   die ('Can\'t use sakila : ' . mysql_error());
}
$sql = "SELECT * FROM movies";
$arr = array();

if (!$rs = mysql_query($sql)){
Echo '{success:false,error: "Database Query Failed"}';
}else{
while($obj = mysql_fetch_object($rs)){
$arr[] = $obj;
}
Echo '{success:true,rows: '.json_encode($arr).'}';
}
?>

The code first links to MySQL and makes a connection with a database called
sakila (it's a test db you can get for MySQL containing fictitious movie
data - within that DB I created a table called movies which has a subset of
columns from it's 'films' table). It then attempts a simple select from the
movies table. If all goes well it then loads the selected rows into an
array and PHP has a rather helpful function called encode which converts an
array into JSON. However if the select returns an error (as it does when I
change the select to be from a deliberately misspelled table name like
'moies' it returns the line highlighted in blue ie a JSON string with
success:false and an error message.

Here's the Ext

<html>
<head>
<title>Template</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
href="extjs/resources/css/ext-all.css" />
<script src="extjs/adapter/ext/ext-base.js"></script>
<script src="extjs/ext-all.js"></script>
<script>
Ext.onReady(function(){
var store = new Ext.data.Store({
url:'get_movies.php',

reader: new Ext.data.JsonReader({
root:'rows',
id:' film_id'
},[
'film_id',
'title'
])
});
store.on('loadexception', function(event,options,response,error) {
var json = Ext.decode(response.responseText);
Ext.Msg.alert('Error', json.error);
       });
store.load();
var grid = new Ext.grid.GridPanel({
renderTo: document.body,
frame: true,
title: 'Movies',
height: 200,
width: 500,
store: store,
columns: [
{header: "Film id", dataindex: 'film_id'},
{header: "Title", dataindex: 'title'}
]
});
});
</script>
</head>

<body>

</body>
</html>

The important thing here is the code highlighted in pink. When the store
attempts to load the returned data it automatically exams the value of
success and if it is set to false it triggers the 'loadexception' event and
the function code runs; the ext.decode method parses the returned JSON and
the error message is displayed in an alert - we could also write to a log
or carry out some alternate action if we wanted to.

Whether this handles the case of a catastophic SAS failure I couldn't say
as of course I couldn't replicate it, but at least we should be able to
handle most errors using this technique as long as we are sure to check the
validity of statements before executing them in SAS.
