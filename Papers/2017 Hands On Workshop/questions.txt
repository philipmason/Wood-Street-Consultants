1 - Can we have the Chrome browser please? 
	If not, Firefox would be second best but would need the Firebug extension installed. 
	Otherwise please let me know what browser we will have.
2 - Is it possible for people to save into a sub-directory of the web-app server. 
	On my SAS install I am putting HTML files into C:\SAS\Config\Lev1\Web\WebServer\htdocs\HOW 
	which means I can run them through the web browser like this ... http://d351tq92/how/menu.html
3 - Can we have Notepad++ installed on windows? It is very useful when editing HTML and javascript code.
4 - Can we have a copy of the PROC JSON tip sheet from SAS for each person in the workshop?
